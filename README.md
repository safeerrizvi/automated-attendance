# **automated-attendance**

*An automated attendance system prototype made using a Raspberry Pi + NEO 6M in C for our first semester university project.*

- Compares long and lat from GPS with cpu time against hardcoded values for the class location and schedule.
- Writes the attendance log in a file shared on the network. 
- Opens browser with current long lat and 10s recording using the Raspberry Pi's microphone from the press of a button.
